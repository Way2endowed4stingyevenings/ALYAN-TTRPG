  "usfrNotes": "The core mechanical loop is a Universal D100 roll-under system. The character creation process is a detailed point-buy/allocation system focused on balancing the six core attributes and their associated skills. The primary unique mechanic is the Sanity system, which must be visually tracked and integrated into the character sheet. The six D100 attributes have been mapped to the Universal Pentagram/Alignment keys for system consistency."
