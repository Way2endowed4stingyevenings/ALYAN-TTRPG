**Status:** Draft - Universal System Conversion

## I. Introduction: The Cost of Knowledge

The Harrowing Truth is a tabletop role-playing game of cosmic horror and survival, where players confront unknowable forces and the terrifying cost of forbidden knowledge. This edition has been converted to utilize the **ALYAN Universal System Core**, ensuring mechanical consistency with *Conflict Horizon* and *Planet of the Song* while retaining its unique thematic dread.

## II. Core Mechanics: Universal D100 Roll-Under

All action resolution in *The Harrowing Truth* uses the Universal D100 Roll-Under System. To succeed at a task, a player rolls a d100 and must achieve a result **equal to or less than** the relevant Attribute or Skill percentage.

| Roll Result | Outcome |
| :--- | :--- |
| **01-05** | Critical Success (Exceptional outcome, grants additional benefits) |
| **< Attribute/Skill** | Success |
| **> Attribute/Skill** | Failure |
| **96-100** | Critical Failure (Disastrous outcome, introduces complications) |

## III. Character Attributes: The Universal Pentagram

To align with the Universal System, the six core attributes of *The Harrowing Truth* have been mapped to the Universal Pentagram and Alignment keys. The underlying mechanics remain D100-based, but the data structure is standardized.

### Attribute Mapping

| Universal Key | Harrowing Truth Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Katra** | Strength (STR) | Physical power, endurance, and melee capability. |
| **Dominion** | Constitution (CON) | Physical resilience, stamina, and resistance to injury/poison. |
| **Imperius** | Dexterity (DEX) | Agility, reflexes, and coordination for stealth and finesse. |
| **Harmonia** | Intelligence (INT) | Analytical aptitude, puzzle-solving, and arcane/scientific understanding. |
| **Gnosis** | Sanity (SAN) | Mental stability and resistance to psychological trauma. |
| **Entropy** | Charisma (CHA) | Social influence, persuasion, and leadership. |

### Attribute Generation

Characters generate their attributes by rolling 3d10 x 10 for each of the six attributes, resulting in a score between **30% and 90%**. These scores are then allocated to the six Universal Keys as desired, reflecting the character's strengths and weaknesses.

## IV. The Sanity System (Gnosis/Entropy)

The core unique mechanic of *The Harrowing Truth* is the **Sanity System**, which is mapped directly to the Universal **Gnosis/Entropy** alignment.

**Gnosis (Sanity)** measures mental stability and resistance to psychological trauma. When a character is exposed to horror, they must make a **Sanity Check** (a D100 roll against their Gnosis percentage).

### Consequences of Low Sanity

| Gnosis Score | Effect |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Below 50%** | The character begins experiencing paranoia, hallucinations, or phobias. |
| **Below 20%** | The character’s ability to function is severely impaired. |
| **0%** | The character succumbs to madness and is removed from play. |

### Sanity Loss Examples

| Event | Sanity Loss (Gnosis Reduction) |
| :--- | :--- |
| Discovering a mutilated body | 1-3 points |
| Witnessing an eldritch ritual | 1d10 points |
| Seeing a cosmic entity | 1d20+5 points |

## V. Skills and Proficiencies

Skills represent specialized expertise tied to one or more attributes.

*   **Untrained Skill:** Using an untrained skill imposes a **+20% penalty** to the roll.
*   **Starting Value:** A skill's base percentage is determined by its associated Universal Attribute (e.g., a skill tied to Katra starts at the character's Katra percentage).

The **Proficiency and Gate Tier System** from the Universal Core is used to further enhance skills, allowing players to invest in tiers (Novice, Adept, Expert, Master, Paragon) to improve their chances of success.

## VI. Subsidiary Resource Manuals

The Core Rulebook focuses on the Universal Mechanics. All setting-specific content, such as detailed lists of **Horror-Themed Combat rules**, **Dark Magic and Rituals**, **Evolving Narrative Consequences**, and **NPC Interactions**, will be organized into separate Subsidiary Resource Manuals for easy reference. This modular approach ensures the Core Rulebook remains focused on the essential mechanics.
