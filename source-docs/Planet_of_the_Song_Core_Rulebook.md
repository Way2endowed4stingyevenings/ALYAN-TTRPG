**Status:** Draft - Universal System Expansion

## I. Introduction: Resonance and Dissonance

*Planet of the Song* is a game of whimsical fantasy and cosmic balance, where characters are attuned to the world's harmonious Song or susceptible to the Void's Dissonance. This edition utilizes the **ALYAN Universal System Core**, focusing on the four core attributes and the unique Resonance/Dissonance alignment to create a distinct play experience.

## II. Core Mechanics: Universal Core System

The game uses the Universal Core System, which includes the D100 Roll-Under mechanic for action resolution.

## III. Character Attributes: The Four Pillars

The four core attributes of *Planet of the Song* are mapped to the Universal Pentagram keys, with the Gnosis/Entropy keys dedicated to the unique Resonance/Dissonance alignment.

### Attribute Mapping

| Universal Key | Planet of the Song Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Katra** | Force | The raw, physical power and kinetic energy a character can exert. |
| **Dominion** | Essence | A character's inner vitality, endurance, and connection to the world's life force. |
| **Imperius** | Arcanum | Mental acuity, knowledge of the world's hidden truths, and the ability to channel the Song. |
| **Harmonia** | Prowess | Agility, finesse, and the skill with which a character executes complex actions. |
| **Gnosis** | Resonance | A character's attunement to the world's harmonious Song. Represents purity, healing, and resistance to the Void. |
| **Entropy** | Dissonance | A character's susceptibility to the Void and the forces of decay. Represents chaos, corruption, and the ability to wield raw, destructive power. |

### Attribute Generation

Characters use a **Point-Buy System** for the four core attributes (Force, Essence, Arcanum, Prowess) to enforce a balanced character concept, similar to the opposed pairs in *Conflict Horizon*.

*   **Opposed Pairs:** The system enforces an antagonistic relationship between the four core attributes, with a fixed total point pool for each pair.
    *   **Force (Katra) vs. Arcanum (Imperius)**
    *   **Essence (Dominion) vs. Prowess (Harmonia)**
*   **Resonance/Dissonance:** These are set separately, often influenced by the character's background and initial choices, and can fluctuate during play.

## IV. Unique Mechanics: Resonance and Dissonance

The Gnosis/Entropy keys are used to track the character's alignment with the world's core conflict.

*   **Resonance (Gnosis):** High Resonance grants bonuses to healing, protective magic, and resisting the effects of the Void.
*   **Dissonance (Entropy):** High Dissonance grants access to powerful, chaotic magic and abilities, but often at a personal cost or risk of corruption.

## V. Subsidiary Resource Manuals

All setting-specific content, such as detailed lists of **Spellcasting Rules**, **Dynamic Attribute Points (DAPs)**, **Factions and Worldbuilding**, and **Song and Void Influences**, will be organized into separate Subsidiary Resource Manuals. This allows for the "meaningful expansion campaign" content to be modularly added without bloating the core rules.
