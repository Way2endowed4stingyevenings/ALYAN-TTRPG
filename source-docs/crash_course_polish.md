# Conflict Horizon: Crash Course Polish - Core Rules and Lore Summary

**Author:** Manus AI
**Date:** November 22, 2025
**Source Document:** Conflict Horizon: Unified Core Rules Draft.docx [1]

This document provides a synthesized summary of the core mechanics and setting lore for the *Conflict Horizon* TTRPG, focusing on the details necessary for the development of the companion application.

## 1. The Palladial Cosmos (Setting & Core Concepts)

The setting is defined by the absolute reliance on **psionics**, amplified by the volatile element **Palladium** [1]. Following a catastrophic past, artificial intelligence (AI) has been banished, making psionics the defining force [1]. The political structure is maintained by the **Psionic Tapestry**, a web of psychic energy that stabilizes interstellar travel and fuels the advanced Beacon Network. This control is constantly threatened by **Void Zones**, chaotic expanses where the laws of nature and psionics are fractured [1].

## 2. Core Mechanics: The D100 System

All actions are resolved by rolling a **d100** against a calculated **Target Number (TN)**. Success occurs if the roll is equal to or below the TN [1].

| Result | Condition | Effect |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Critical Success** | Rolling doubles below 50 (e.g., 11, 22). | Grants enhanced effect, automatic critical hit, or gain of hidden information [1]. |
| **Critical Failure** | Rolling doubles above 60 (e.g., 88, 99). | Results in a catastrophe, collateral damage, or unintended consequences [1]. |

### The Pentagram System: Attributes and Alignment

The universe is ruled by the Pentagram System, establishing an inherent, antagonistic relationship between the four core Attributes. **Increasing one attribute naturally reduces its opposite**, maintaining balance [1].

| Core Attribute | Element | Focus / Narrative Role | Opposing Attribute |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Katra** | Air | Physical Action, Agility, Instinct-Driven Movement | Imperius |
| **Dominion** | Earth | Control, Endurance, Resilience, Stability | Harmonia |
| **Imperius** | Fire | Command, Willpower, Aggression, Force of Personality | Katra |
| **Harmonia** | Water | Balance, Empathy, Healing, Emotional Equilibrium | Dominion |

The two Cosmic Forces define a character's disposition:
*   **Gnosis:** Structure, Foresight, Understanding, Order. Powers manifest with precision and calculation [1].
*   **Entropy:** Adaptability, Destruction, Change, Chaos. Powers manifest chaotically, destructively, or adaptively [1].

### Proficiency and Gate System

The **Gate** is a Modifier Die assigned to an Attribute, limiting the potential of all linked Proficiencies [1].

| Proficiency Tier | Modifier Die (Gate) | Advancement Rule |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tier 1 (Novice)** | d6 | Roll D100 against Attribute + Current Bonus. If successful, roll the Modifier Die and add result to the Bonus. |
| **Tier 2 (Adept)** | d8 | Unlocks limited exotic uses. |
| **Tier 3 (Expert)** | d10 | Allows Attribute substitution for certain rolls. |
| **Tier 4 (Master)** | d12 | Unlocks advanced, specialized capabilities. |
| **Paragon** | d20 | Highest tier, potential for reality-altering power. |

## 3. Character Creation: The Imperial Funnel

The character creation process is a **five-step funnel** where choices in one step limit the options in the next, tying heritage to cosmic fate [1].

| Step | Name | Constraint |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Step 1** | **Imperial Birth Vector (12 Total)** | Determines the character's fundamental Palladial heritage, tying a Core Attribute to an Alignment (e.g., Katra/Gnosis, Dominion/Entropy) [1]. |
| **Step 2** | **Imperial Point of Origin (12 Total)** | Chosen based on the Birth Vector's Arc, limiting the choice to three adjacent Arcs [1]. |
| **Step 3** | **Factional Resonance (36 Total)** | Political/ideological allegiance, chosen from the three Factions (House, Guild, Discordant) associated with the Point of Origin's Zodiac Arc [1]. |
| **Step 4** | **Imperial Occupational Edicts (12 Total)** | The chosen Edict (Archetype) determines the Proficiency package and initial Paragon Power [1]. |
