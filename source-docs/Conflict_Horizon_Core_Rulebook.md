**Author:** Manus AI
**Date:** Nov 25, 2025
**Status:** Final - Universal System Core

## I. Introduction: The Palladial Universe

*Conflict Horizon* is the foundational game for the ALYAN Universal System, a setting of grim sci-fi and psionic warfare in the Palladial Universe. It is the definitive implementation of the Universal Core mechanics.

## II. Core Mechanics: Universal Core System

All action resolution uses the Universal Core System, which is a **D100 Roll-Under System** with a focus on the Pentagram Attributes.

## III. Character Attributes: The Pentagram System

The six Universal Keys are the primary attributes in *Conflict Horizon*.

### Attribute Mapping

| Universal Key | Conflict Horizon Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Katra** | Katra (Physical) | Air • Physical Action, Agility, Instinct-Driven Movement. |
| **Dominion** | Dominion (Endurance) | Earth • Control, Endurance, Resilience, Stability. |
| **Imperius** | Imperius (Will/Social) | Fire • Command, Willpower, Aggression, Force of Personality. |
| **Harmonia** | Harmonia (Empathy/Psionic) | Water • Balance, Empathy, Healing, Emotional Equilibrium. |
| **Gnosis** | Gnosis (Order) | The character's alignment toward Order and Structure. |
| **Entropy** | Entropy (Chaos) | The character's alignment toward Chaos and Destruction. |

### Attribute Generation

Characters use a **Point-Buy System** that enforces an antagonistic relationship between the four core Pentagram Attributes:

*   **Opposed Pairs:**
    *   **Katra vs. Imperius** (Total 20 points)
    *   **Dominion vs. Harmonia** (Total 20 points)
*   **Gnosis/Entropy:** These are tracked on a single axis from -100 (Entropy) to +100 (Gnosis).

## IV. Unique Mechanics: Imperial Funnel and Psionics

*   **Imperial Funnel:** A five-step character creation process (Birth Vector, Point of Origin, Faction, Edict) that determines starting proficiencies and attributes.
*   **Psionics:** Psionic powers are tied to the Harmonia attribute and the Gnosis/Entropy alignment, often involving a **Tarot Card Draw** mechanic (the standardized "Card Draw" mechanic) to determine power and backlash.

## V. Subsidiary Resource Manuals

All setting-specific content, such as detailed lists of **Imperial Funnel Options**, **Psionic Powers and Backlash Tables**, and **Faction Lore**, will be organized into separate Subsidiary Resource Manuals.
